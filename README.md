# extract-exercises

Python code provided by Toby Hodges from The Carpentries ⭐ (and slightly modified by myself) to extract exercises for lessons in the Carpentries Workbench format from episode text.
The code writes the result to `stdout`.

## Execution

Copy the Python script into the `episodes` folder of the lesson.

Run as: 
`$ python3 extract_exercises.py *.md > exercises.md` from the `episodes` folder.
